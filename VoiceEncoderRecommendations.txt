# Voice Encoder Options List

This document provides a list of well-regarded voice encoder models along with details on how to access their code or API services.

---

## 1. Resemblyzer

- **Description:**  
  A Python package that extracts a fixed-dimensional embedding representing a speaker’s vocal characteristics while largely ignoring the spoken content. Frequently used for speaker verification, clustering, and similarity tasks.

- **Access:**  
  - GitHub: [resemble-ai/Resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer)
  - Installation: Installable via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install resemblyzer
    ```

- **Usage:**  
  Comes with demos and examples showing how to load audio files, compute speaker embeddings, and compare embeddings between different voices.

## 2. Real-Time Voice Cloning (SV2TTS)

- **Description:**  
  Part of a full voice cloning system that includes a dedicated speaker encoder. While its main goal is voice cloning, you can repurpose just the encoder to obtain voice embeddings from audio snippets.

- **Access:**  
  - Main Repository: [CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning)
  - Alternative Fork: [1Reyhan/reyhan-Real-Time-Voice-Cloning](https://github.com/1Reyhan/reyhan-Real-Time-Voice-Cloning)

- **Usage:**  
  The repository includes training and inference scripts. You might need to isolate or adjust the encoder component based on your specific project needs.

## 3. EasyVC

- **Description:**  
  A toolkit designed for any-to-any voice conversion using an encoder-decoder framework. It incorporates several encoders—including a speaker encoder—to separate voice characteristics from linguistic content.

- **Access:**  
  - GitHub: [MingjieChen/EasyVC](https://github.com/MingjieChen/EasyVC)

- **Usage:**  
  Although the overall goal is voice conversion, you can extract and use the speaker encoder module for obtaining voice embeddings.

## 4. SpeechBrain

- **Description:**  
  An open-source toolkit for diverse speech processing tasks, including speaker verification and voice embedding extraction. It provides several pre-trained models known for robustness and production-readiness.

- **Access:**  
  - GitHub: [speechbrain/speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain)
  - Hugging Face Model Hub: [SpeechBrain models](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain)

- **Usage:**  
  With extensive documentation and example scripts, SpeechBrain lets you experiment with different architectures (like ECAPA-TDNN) to extract speaker embeddings. Ideal for benchmarking or deploying speaker encoders.

## 5. Pyannote.audio

- **Description:**  
  Primarily targeted at speaker diarization, this toolkit also provides pre-trained speaker embedding models capable of handling challenging multi-speaker conditions.

- **Access:**  
  - GitHub: [pyannote/pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio)

- **Usage:**  
  Its robust pretrained embeddings can be directly used for clustering, speaker verification, or as a feature extractor in other applications.

---

## 6. Hugging Face Inference API (for Voice Encoders)

- **Description:**  
  Many voice encoder models are available on the Hugging Face Model Hub, allowing you to use an API for quick inference without the need for local model management.

- **Access:**  
  - Hugging Face Model Hub — [Speaker Recognition Models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=speaker-recognition)

- **Usage:**  
  This is a convenient option if you prefer not to host models yourself. Models from libraries like SpeechBrain are available here, enabling you to easily integrate speaker encoder functionality via API calls.

# Final Considerations

Each option has its own strengths:
- **Resemblyzer** is lightweight and straightforward for simply obtaining embeddings.
- **SpeechBrain** and **Pyannote.audio** provide robust, production-grade options with extensive documentation and community support.
- The **Hugging Face Inference API** offers an easy-to-use, API-based approach without the overhead of managing your own infrastructure.

Choose the one that best aligns with your project requirements, and consider benchmarking them to see which offers the performance and reliability you need.
